# Biography

I'm Bram van der Sanden, currently a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.tue.nl/universiteit/faculteiten/electrical-engineering/faculteit/medewerkers/detail/ep/e/d/ep-uid/20086494/ep-tab/4/" target="_blank">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>. My research focuses on the intersection of computer science, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. I look at model-based system engineering, including modeling, simulation, verification and optimization. The research focus is on on automatically generating supervisory controllers that satisfy functional requirements and are optimized with respect to performance criteria such as throughput. Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of the project, ideas and techniques are used from various fields including system engineering, supervisory controller synthesis, game theory, data flow, max-plus algebra and formal verification methods.
