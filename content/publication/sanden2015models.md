abstract = "Development of high-level supervisory controllers is an important challenge in the design of high-tech systems. It has become a significant issue due to increased complexity, combined with demands for verified quality, time to market, ease of development, and integration of new functionality. To deal with these challenges, model-based engineering approaches are suggested as a cost-effective way to support easy adaptation, validation, synthesis, and verification of controllers. This paper presents an industrial case study on modular design of a supervisory controller for wafer logistics in lithography machines. The uncontrolled system and control requirements are modeled independently in a modular way, using small, loosely coupled and minimally restrictive extended finite automata. The multiparty synchronization mechanism that is part of the specification formalism provides clear advantages in terms of modularity, traceability, and adaptability of the model. We show that being able to refer to variables and states of automata in guard expressions and state-based requirements, enabled by the use of extended finite automata, provides concise models. Additionally, we show how modular synthesis allows construction of local supervisors that ensure safety of parts of the system, since monolithic synthesis is not feasible for our industrial case."
